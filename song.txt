I made another mistake, thought I could change
Thought I could make it out
Promises break, need to hear you say
You're gonna keep it now

I miss the way you say my name
The way you bend, the way you break
Your makeup running down your face
The way you touch, the way you taste

When the curtains call the time
Will we both go home alive?
It wasn't hard to realize
Love's the death of peace of mind

You're in the walls that I made with crosses and frames
Hanging upside down
For granted, in vain, I took everything
I ever cared about
